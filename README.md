# re0_translations

Repository for translations of content from [Re:Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re:Zero), like side stories

Project files use the [OmegaT](https://omegat.org/) CAT for translation and translation memory

It's recommended to use [my fork of OmegaT](https://github.com/liraymond/omegat), as it includes fixes for storing and using multiple reference language TMX files in a central translation memory folder

The dictionary used is the [CC-CEDICT](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cedict) Chinese-English dictionary, and a conversion to the [Stardict format](https://simonwiles.net/projects/cc-cedict/) for use in OmegaT
